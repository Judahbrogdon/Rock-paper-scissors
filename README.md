# Capstone Project - 2024/2025

This is your final coding project for the year.
In this project you will create a game.
You have much freedom and leeway with this project. 
There are a few basic requirements - beyond that, you may make this as simple or as complicated as you like.

Requirements:
 - Project and function level code comments
 - Minimum 5 functions
    - at least one function must take in at least one argument
 - Some sort of user interaction
 - Must use at least one of the data structures we learned about [list, dictionary, tuple, set]. Must be used appropriately.
 - If a command-line game, user must have the ability to keep playing until they decide to quit.


As with all other assignments in this class, use of any AI tool, including, but not limited to ChatGPT and Copilot are not permitted.

You must type out every line of code
You must understand every line of code and be able to explain and defend every line of code in your final program. (Points may be lost if you cannot).
You may use W3Schools.
If you choose to use a library, you may use that library documentation.

You may use Google to search for help on a specific task, but you must be able to fully explain and defend any code you use, and you must type (not copy-paste) everything in your final submission.

If you are unsure about where the ethical line is, ask! :)

If I see fit, I will ask follow up questions of your code - points may be lost if you are unable to sufficiently answer those follow up questions. Such questions will be focused on decisions made in the code and what certain lines of code are doing - similar to the expectations on the Hangman project.

Project suggestions:
- Rock-paper-scissors
- Asteroids
- Tic Tac Toe
- Snake game
- Dot connect game
- Word scamble
- A Quiz game
- Mad libs
